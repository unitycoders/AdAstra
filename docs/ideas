Here is a list of the ideas (user facing) for AdAstra

# Actions
* Can build and customise ships
	* Can be speicalised for diffrent needs
* Can Trade with other players/AI
* Can colonise planets
* Can mine asteroids to produce resources
* Can build and customise space stations (like planets, but in space)
* Can attack other player's ships
* Can raid other player's ships, stations and planets for recourses
* Can capture ships, planets and stations
* Can research new technologies for new buildings, ships components, station modules, etc...

# Planets
* Aquire resources from planet (mining)
* Build, Repair and refit ships
* Conduct research
* Build buildings, Components and modules
* Refine materals to make better materials

# Ships
* Customisable hardware/components
* Diffrent sizes and configurations
* Limited line of sight
* Player owned and controllable

# Orginal (JGame) ideas - need to be integrated with above
* A player has many resources, each can be used to construct assets
* Each resource can be mined from asteroids
* A resource can be traded between players
* Tasks can constume rescoures, such as building
* Objects which can be controlled by a player can be issued tasks to proform
  * These tasks can be context senstive (attack, defend only apply to ships)
* A player has a finite amount of time, avilable each tick
* A tick occours every n secounds of game time. 'turns' happen at the same time.
