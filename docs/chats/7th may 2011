let me guess, 2 main viewpoints - galaxy and then ability to zoom into an individual sector?
[You]
yep
The idea being, it makes controlling areas of the map more feasable and allows for larger areas of play
[Piers Williams]
yup - fair enough
will there be different sized slots on the planets that can be built on? will all planets be the same?
[You]
Not sure, Planets with verying numbers of slots is kinda the idea for diffrent planet classes
as for what can go in those slots (ie diffrent sizes) i've not really thought about it
[Piers Williams]
ok, will the environment on the planet have an effect?
[You]
I've not really thought about it, would be cool if it did
[Piers Williams]
ok, i assume to avoid having to write an AI this is multiplayer?
[You]
I want to allow for both, because writing an AI for such a complex game could be a world of fun :P
[Piers Williams]
ok, but multiplayer would be cool - if a player wanted to - could he allocate a build slot to an ally?
something missing from most games these days but happens in the real world
[You]
Hmm, haven't thought about that, but that could be rather intresting
[Piers Williams]
indeed - including perhaps allocating hardpoints on a ship to allies too
exact same mechanic
[You]
hardpoints on a ship could be a bit difficault because then you've got ambigutiy over who can give orders to the ship
players can trade/give hardware for hardpoints to other players though (trade)
[Piers Williams]
the owner of the hull - bit if Player A has technology researched but not the ability to build a ship of their own
say weapon tech they could equip allies to help out
[You]
that could be cool
[Piers Williams]
indeed
i'm good at poking holes in things lol
[You]
lol, ideas are never a bad thing
[Piers Williams]
Game Asset seems a bit confusing - you mean like fleets of ships?
[You]
the term is simply a blanket term for any item on the field of play
Ships, planets, etc..
[Piers Williams]
ok, it'll get cluttered if too much is allowed with them - maybe only vital info about planets from that level - movement of ships only etc
Turn based or real time?
[You]
Tick, so a cross between the two, turn based but turns happen simultaneously with perioidic updates
you can think of it as a real time game with a turn based approch
[Piers Williams]
ok, that sounds like its gonna trip up a bit
[You]
yeah, i'm not sure how best to do it, i mean, real time could work but for multiplayer could trip up
[Piers Williams]
on the other hand - turn based is simple
[You]
I mean most of the code i've written doesn't care
[Piers Williams]
but you could switch to real time for battles?
[You]
hmm, could do, turn based where you each take it in terns you have to wait for the others to finish which is annoying if a player gives up or doesn't have time to play
[Piers Williams]
time out? agree a time limit for all turns?
[You]
yeah, that's pretty much what i had in mind, only with turns occouring at the same time
[Piers Williams]
so people could plan everything that will happen, when everyone is finished, the game will switch to real time but people can't influence their decisions anymore?
trouble is if you go to attack something, which then moves ...

AdAstra planets, say I wanted to support diffrent types of planet, would DesertPlanet extends Planet or Planet which contains a PlanetClass object work better I wonder
I've built ships using the secound method (ship has a hull and an array of hardware) 13:31:30
 
Barry 'Canis' Attwater 13:32:54
cool	

Joseph Walton-Rivers 13:34:31
the ships method works really well for ships, means i don't need 50 million subclasses and each ship can be diffrent (which is fantastic), Also means you can link to ships to the same hull, but i don't know why you would do that (although depending on where I store health could be more memory effeicent)
I've also come up with a really simple. elegant way to deal with diffrent types of hardware which means i don't need crazy adaptor classes anymore \o/ 13:35:41
 
Barry 'Canis' Attwater 13:37:11
	

Joseph Walton-Rivers 13:42:11
still need a way for a ship to tell the game, "oh shit, i blew up"
oh, something else you might be able to help with 13:42:49
ids, the way I've basiclly made it so that hardware can do more than one thing is there is a use() method with an ID, and i need to make sure IDs don't conflict between modules (inless it's indended) 13:43:49
I was thinking about something like hardwareArrayID+ActionID but then things like weapons, which all need to share the same action ID for Fire wouldn't work 13:44:46
maybe give hardware the option of using some kind of offset but they don't have to? 13:47:17
or maybe don't use IDs but rather some kind of class 13:48:03
but then I'd have to share the class between all the Hardware 13:48:24
what do you think? 13:48:29
 
Barry 'Canis' Attwater 13:52:04
i dont know, sorry, both seem a but of an odd say to do it

(sorry, facebook didn't copy names from the group chat)

hey, just easier to talk with a group message than to you sepratly :)
hehe
magical sparkally group
so people could plan everything that will happen, when everyone is finished, the game will switch to real time but people can't influence their decisions anymore?
pretty much hit it on the head
it's the group we created for AI
indeed
yay, seems like Heroes of Might And Magic almost
never played
ah ok lol
i assume you are updating the design lol ...
keeping a log of the chat so i can update the design :)
cool
so will there be the concept of fleets? containing multiple ships that can then engage in battles?
obviously lonely ships will be in a fleet of their own i guess
i take it this is currently for astra, right?
yeah, i'm poking holes
if anybody has played Star Wars Empire At War then space combat so far seems alot like that - with hardpoints etc
I've created a folder on git called chats, i'll upload the log to converting into design docs at a later date :)
cool
I've not, but the idea was based off a very old game called XCOM
lol, do some research into EAW - it was released in about 2006 but was fully real-time
well, real-time galactically but that paused for a real time space/land fight
As for combat, should the outcome be derimed automaticlly or via user input?
user input - automated stuff rarely works well enough
plus turns the game into who is the better economist rather than strategist
agreed
will damage to ships be persistant? will it cost anything to repair?
the ships have HP so yes, damage should be persistant and repairable on planets using a building, I wasn't sure about wether to need recourses for repair
hardpoints have individual hp? and be targettable/destructable?
so take out the engines, reduce speed etc
that's definatly do-able, just adding HP to hardware class would enable that
and be much better for the game - adds good tactics
that reminds me
why does the ship has sepereate hardwere and hull
17:44
plus means redundancy might be worth it - the cost of having 2 shield generators may be good, even if shield strength isn't increased
although you'd have to decide on the physics to implement shields etc
modularity
like a car today - you get to pick the engine, the number of doors and how the seats are
anyways i have to go prepare dinner, cya later
yeah, i wasn't sure how to limit the use of hardpoints, i could think of two ways:

1) make hardware have requirements which other modules satify, like Power

2) limit the categories of hardware which can be placed in hardpoints

what do you mean by hardpoints btw?
A place where a peice of hardware can be attached to the vessel
ah

which do you think would work better?
it depends on how much hardware is not ship persiffic
not ship specific?
unless ya mean that x,y and z cant be placed in hardpoint 1
yeah
ah
the i think opsion 2 may be better
method 1) all hardware can be placed but you have to place things like generators to give you power (your ship needs 2 generators for a really big weapon and a sheild)

method 2) only some hardware types can be placed in spesifc slots (weapons in a weapon slot, etc..)
just to clairfy ^

i think method 2 would be easyer to code latter on

17:53
because when u do attack, u know which hardpoints should have your weapons on it
yeah, makes sense, the main reason for A was to prevent people overloading ships with too many powerful weapons (but a larger number of smaller weapons could be allowed)

17:57
but with method 2 u have a set number of weapons anyway, so as long as u dont get ambushed by way too powerfull enermys
I mean, it's not exactly either/or it's just if you think it would work
wb peirs
you could still place the power requirement idea into things - to make a believable reason for limiting how much weaponry they can have
but i think let them - if they want it bristling with weapons then they won't have enough power for shields, and that will leave them at a disaddvantage
yeah, it's just do we add the concept of 'power' to ships or not
yeah - its realistic and simple enough
people understand it and it provides the balance needed
but is the power generator targetable or not?
and if it is, when knocked out - what happens to the ship

yeah - its realistic and simple enough

but is the power generator targetable or not?
and if it is, when knocked out - what happens to the ship
hmm, exactly, we'd have to check the power level each action if it can be knocked out, but in the same token it could be used as part of a tactic, as long as their not too easy to knock out
i reckon the hull should have a main power generator that never gets destroyed unless the ship is lost, but extra generators can be placed which are destructable
so each hull would have a 'base power' attribute as it were
yeah - and when you "design" a class of ship, you choose which weapons are wired to which generators
and scout ships could examine dead ships to find out that info about enemies, so that the player can better choose which generator to knock out
hmm, could be quite difficault to code, I was thinking of having a single 'pool' of power
lovely tactics :p
nah not difficult to code
although as a tactic that would be quite intresting
(have you seen the vessel class? :P)
tactic is missing from most modern strategy games -
someone needs to bring it back :p
exactly
if there is one thing AdAstra seems to have lots of it's tactics :P
Battwa?
18:03
hmm, capturing would be good for gathering intel
players could have like a wiki available, which when they have owned a ship it adds the intricate details (Basically what the screen looked like just before it was finished being designed)
could work, but that would require classes of ships, the design at the moment is basiclly each ship is invidually refit-able

18:06
you can write the game to support that - but if the build menu simply allowed you to build something you defined earlier that would be much better
like templates?
you don't want to have to individually kit out 50 destroyers
yeah, templates
Galactic Civilisation II allowed you to "design" ships like that
however, they're not customisable after creation
and then build the templates
any empty slots can be filled individually at any shipyard later?
or the design can be updated and existing ships "refitted" at a cost to match
indiviaul would be better
considering that hardware is tradable as an individual component
ie. 4 x engine type 1 and 3 x weapon type 2
Write the game to be individual, but allow ships to be built to templates as well?
yeah
SupCom had templates for buildings which were awesome, but otherwise was a normal RTS for building
and the templates only palced stuff there - once built, nothing was different about the individual parts
exactly
(also means templates can be almost entirely GUI/Client side)
yeah - and templates should persist across different games
i used to play on my own in SupCom so i could max my economy, build stuff in pretty patterns and save them as templates - without the hassle of combat to slow me down
makes sense, allows players design their stragery and stick to it, one of the nicer parts about GalCiv2

got to go - watching dr who with dani (my sister)
