# Ad Astra High Level Design

## Game Asset
A game asset is any object which can be represented in a sector. Each asset in the game is
unique and may or may not be player controllable. Most player owned assets are exapandable
in some way.

### Planets
Each planet can be colonised by a player, and the player starts off with 1 planet when the game
starts. A colonised planet may have buildings built upon it. Each building provides one or more
services to the planet and aids the player.

Planets will be of diffrent qualities, effecting the number of building slots avilable on each planet.
The type of planet may also have other effects on the planet, these effects are to be decided.

### Vessels/Ships
The player can build ships, each ship consits of a hull (which cannot be changed once built)
and a series of hardware. The hull provides a list of the avilable spaces in which hardware 
can be placed (hardpoints).

Each vessel has a limited amount of health and can be owned by a single player, they can be
 captured by other players. The vessels should somehow be limited in what can be attached to
them (a vessel should not be able to consist 10 weapons and nothing else).

### Stations
TODO

### Natueral resouces
are minable TODO 

## Map Layout
The Ad Astra map layout consists of a series of sectors linked together by gateways. The only
means of travel between sectors is via these gateways. The sectors and their links form an
undirected cyclic graph. This graph forms the whole game play area (the galaxy).

Each sector is unique and consisits of game assets. Each asset is at a location given by an x,y
location and sector. This uniquely identifes the asset's location in the galaxy.

### Viewpoints
The game is viewable from two main viewpoints, the overall view of the galaxy, allowing the
user to select a sector and a sector view. The sector view is where most of the user's interaction
with the game will take place; issuing orders to vessels and selecting planets.

## GamePlay
The Game will be both multiplayer and Single player (with AI) playable.

* Fleets/Vessel Groupings
* Persistant Damage of ships, with hardware disabling
* Hardware in certian types of slots, but with power requirements
* Ship Templates
 * Templates are persistant
* Players could have like a wiki available, which when they have owned a ship it adds the intricate details (Basically what the screen looked like just before it was finished being designed)


### Time Management
Still undecided (see 7th may 2011 chat log), possiblies include
 - Turn Based
 - Tick Based
 - Real Time
 - Any combination of the above

"so people could plan everything that will happen, when everyone is finished, the game will switch to real time but people can't influence their decisions anymore?" -- Piers

Player interactions should be possible with battles, not automated resolution.

### Muliplayer Features
* if a player wanted to - could he allocate a build slot to an ally - Piers
* perhaps allocating hardpoints on a ship to allies too - Piers
