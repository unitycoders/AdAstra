# Ad Astra High Level Design

## Game Asset
A game asset is any object which can be represented in a sector. Each asset in the game is
unique and may or may not be player controllable. Most player owned assets are exapandable
in some way.

### Planets
Each planet can be colonised by a player, and the player starts off with 1 planet when the game
starts. A colonised planet may have buildings built upon it. Each building provides one or more
services to the planet and aids the player.

### Vessels/Ships
The player can build ships, each ship consits of a hull (which cannot be changed once built)
and a series of hardware. The hull provides a list of the avilable spaces in which hardware 
can be placed (hardpoints).

Each vessel has a limited amount of health and can be owned by a single player, they can be
 captured by other players. The vessels should somehow be limited in what can be attached to
them (a vessel should not be able to consist 10 weapons and nothing else).

### Stations

### Natueral resouces
are minable TODO 

## Map Layout
The Ad Astra map layout consists of a series of sectors linked together by gateways. The only
means of travel between sectors is via these gateways. The sectors and their links form an
undirected cyclic graph. This graph forms the whole game play area (the galaxy).

Each sector is unique and consisits of game assets. Each asset is at a location given by an x,y
location and sector. This uniquely identifes the asset's location in the galaxy.
